## ⭐ Situation  
A large, unstructured accident dataset (2020–2021) made it difficult to quickly understand severity levels, patterns, and high-risk factors.

## 🎯 Task  
Analyze over 3 lakh accident records and build an interactive Excel dashboard highlighting:
- Accident severity  
- Vehicle types  
- Environmental and road conditions  
- Area-wise split (Rural vs Urban)  
- Year-over-Year monthly trends  

## ⚙️ Action  
Using Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers):
- Cleaned and transformed ~300k records  
- Built KPI visuals (doughnut charts, bar charts, line charts)  
- Added slicers for Year, Area, Vehicle Type, Weather  
- Designed an interactive, easy-to-understand dashboard  

## 📊 Result  
- **Total Casualties:** 453.1k  
- **Fatal:** 8.3k | **Serious:** 66.3k | **Slight:** 378.5k  
- **Top Vehicle:** Cars — 355.6k casualties  
- **Area Split:** Urban 274.3k | Rural 178.7k  
- **Environmental Insights:**  
  - Fine weather & Dry roads had the highest casualties  
- **Trend:** Full 2020 vs 2021 Monthly YoY comparison
